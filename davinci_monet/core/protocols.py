"""Protocol definitions for DAVINCI components.

This module defines the interfaces (Protocols) for the pluggable data-source and
pairing components. Using runtime_checkable Protocols enables static type
checking while maintaining flexibility for the plugin architecture.

Only the contracts that real implementations actually conform to live here.
Plotters, metrics, and the statistics calculator are concrete base classes in
their own subpackages (``plots.base.BasePlotter``, ``stats.metrics.BaseMetric``,
``stats.calculator.StatisticsCalculator``) and are not modelled as protocols.

Data Geometry Types:
    - point: Fixed locations (surface stations, ground sites)
    - track: 3D trajectories (aircraft, mobile platforms)
    - profile: Vertical profiles (sondes, lidar)
    - swath: 2D satellite footprints (L2 products)
    - grid: Regular gridded data (L3 products, reanalysis)

class PairingStrategy(Protocol):
    """Protocol for source-pairing strategies.

    Concrete strategies expose ``pair_sources(x_data, y_data, **kwargs)`` and
    return a single paired ``xr.Dataset``. By contract a strategy emits the x
    side under its bare variable name and the y side under a ``y_`` prefix; it
    sets **no** ``axis``/``source_label`` attrs. The :class:`PairingEngine`
    (``pairing.engine``) is the sole writer of those attrs and the sole point
    that relabels variables to the public ``<source_label>_<var>`` form.

    Option contract
    ---------------
    The engine passes these options (some by name, some via ``**kwargs``); a
    strategy must accept all of them and may ignore any it does not use:

    - ``radius_of_influence``, ``time_tolerance``, ``vertical_method``,
      ``horizontal_method``, ``time_method`` (by name);
    - ``x_vars``/``y_vars`` and the single-variable ``x_var``/``y_var``
      (via ``**kwargs``).

    Caveats (currently true, not yet unified):

    - ``time_method`` is honored **only** by ``PointStrategy``; every other
      geometry uses nearest-time alignment regardless of its value.
    - ``method: grid`` is a separate symmetric-binning route in the engine
      (``IntermediateGridStrategy``) that does **not** flow through this protocol's
      option set or the temporal-overlap guard; it is driven by ``time_resolution``.

    Concrete strategy classes may keep an internal ``pair(dataset, geometry,
    ...)`` method that ``pair_sources`` delegates to, but it is not part of this
    public contract.
