# Contributing to DAVINCI-MONET

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide covers the essentials
for getting started.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository and create the conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate davinci-monet
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2. Verify your setup:

   ```bash
   pytest
   mypy davinci_monet
   ```

## Running Checks

Before submitting changes, run all three:

```bash
pytest                  # Tests
mypy davinci_monet      # Type checking
black davinci_monet && isort davinci_monet  # Formatting
```

## Git Workflow

- **`develop`** is the primary working branch. Create feature branches from it
  and open PRs back to `develop`.
- **`main`** is for releases only. Do not open PRs directly to `main` unless
  cutting a release.
- Keep commits focused. Use descriptive commit messages that explain *why*,
  not just *what*.

## Code Style

- **Formatting**: black + isort (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- **Type hints**: Required on all public functions and methods.
- **Module size**: Keep modules under 500 lines. If a file is growing past
  that, split it.
- **Data model**: Use xarray throughout pairing and analysis. Pandas is
  acceptable for I/O adapters and statistics output tables only.
- **Variable naming**: Paired datasets use prefix format (`model_pm25`,
  `obs_pm25`), not suffix.

## Project Conventions

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed conventions including:

- Pipeline stage contracts and YAML configuration patterns
- Plot styling (NCAR branding, color conventions)
- CESM vertical coordinate handling
- The pre-implementation audit checklist (required before building new
  components)

## Cross-Model AI Review

This project uses AI-assisted development with cross-model code reviews.
If you find `REVIEW_*.md` or `HANDOFF_*.md` files in the repo root, these
are structured handoff documents for AI review workflows. See the
"Cross-Model Handoff Convention" section in `CLAUDE.md` for the format.

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue with:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (include config YAML if relevant)
- Python and conda environment versions (`conda list`)
